        <h3>HUMAN NATURE WE DO NOT SEE</h3>

          <h4>The Microplastic Photographer</h4>
          <div class="article-byline">Article by: Nya Dombrowski</div>

          <p>When people speak of nature photography...</p>
          <div class="read-more" onclick="openModal(`HUMAN NATURE WE DO NOT SEE`, `The Microplastic Photographer`, `Nya Dombrowski`, 'plastic.jpg', `When people speak of nature photography, they often picture sweeping landscapes, untouched forests, and wild creatures. But what if we turned the lens to the unnatural elements infiltrating our environment—tiny particles that escape the naked eye but carry massive consequences? As a microplastic photographer, I aim to reveal a different side of nature—one that reflects our impact and urges action. Microplastics, fragments of synthetic polymers less than five millimeters in size, are everywhere—from the deepest trenches of the ocean to the remotest mountaintops. They swirl through our waterways, settle into our soils, and even drift through the air we breathe. These tiny invaders have become an invisible yet pervasive part of our ecosystems. And while the damage they cause can be backed by statistics and scientific reports, my goal is to render their presence visible—to make people stop, look, and feel something.
<p> With macro lenses and microscopy techniques, I photograph samples collected from beaches, rivers, and urban runoff systems. What emerges is an uncanny blend of beauty and disturbance: brightly colored fragments that resemble gemstones, synthetic fibers woven through grains of sand, beads and pellets nestled among organic matter. At first glance, these images might be mistaken for abstract art or vibrant textile patterns—but upon closer inspection, the unsettling truth is revealed. </p>
<p>Each photo I take tells a story of human convenience and environmental consequence. A single plastic bottle cap found on a beach may have broken down over decades, its shards scattered among seaweed and shell fragments. A synthetic thread found in a fish’s stomach may trace back to a washing machine load from a thousand miles away. The microplastics themselves bear no logos or brand names, but they carry a narrative of consumer culture, waste, and systemic neglect. </p>
<p>This work isn’t about demonizing plastic outright—after all, it’s a material that has brought medical, technological, and logistical progress. Instead, it's about reckoning with excess, overproduction, and the illusion of “away” when we throw something out. My photography invites viewers to reflect on their daily habits: the toothbrushes replaced every few months, the glitter on a holiday card, the synthetic fleece jacket worn on a hike. These are the everyday choices that accumulate into a global crisis. </p>
<p>In schools, galleries, and environmental workshops, I pair these images with context—data, stories, and sometimes even the physical samples themselves. I want young people, especially, to see that photography isn’t just about capturing beauty; it’s also a tool for storytelling, advocacy, and awareness. By turning something as elusive as microplastic pollution into something visible and tangible, I hope to inspire a new generation of artists and environmental stewards. </p>
<p>In many ways, my work sits at the intersection of science and art. It relies on careful collection, documentation, and methodology, but it is ultimately driven by emotion—by a deep grief for what is being lost and a hope for what might still be saved. Nature photography has long served as a celebration of the natural world; now, I believe it must also become a call to protect it. My lens does not just seek beauty—it seeks truth, no matter how uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Because if we cannot see what’s broken, how can we ever hope to repair it? </p>

        <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY MEANS WE ARE NOT FORGOTTEN</h3>
        <div class="article-content">
          <h4>Our Descendants Will See More of Us Than Ever Before</h4>
          <div class="article-byline">Article by: Ray Berk</div>

          <p>I have spent most of my life behind the camera...</p>
          <div class="read-more" onclick="openModal(`PHOTOGRAPHY MEANS WE ARE NOT FORGOTTEN`, `Our Descendants Will See More of Us Than Ever Before`, `Ray Berk`, 'familyportrait.jpg', `I have spent most of my life behind the camera, not in front of it. But the images I take—of friends, of family, of strangers and moments—will long outlive me. In a digital world, where photos are abundant, it’s the intent behind the lens that preserves us. Our photos are our legacy.There’s something both humbling and empowering about being the unseen observer. I’ve never been drawn to the spotlight or the posed smile. Instead, I gravitate toward what unfolds naturally: the pause before a laugh, the hand that lingers too long in a goodbye, the way light filters through a kitchen window at 4 p.m. These are the moments I live for—fleeting fragments of life that might go unnoticed, but once captured, can speak louder than words.
<p> for me, has always been less about aesthetics and more about memory. When I lift my camera, I’m not just taking a picture—I’m bearing witness. I’m preserving someone’s joy, their sorrow, their solitude, their connection. The shutter is not a barrier between myself and the world but a bridge that brings me closer to it. Each frame is an act of empathy, an attempt to understand the human experience in all its complexity. </p>
<p> Over the years, my relationship with photography has evolved. What began as a quiet hobby—a way to make sense of the world—has become a calling, a responsibility even. I think about the people whose stories I’ve captured. Some are still here. Others are not. Some I knew intimately; others I met for only a moment. But they all live on, framed in light and shadow. In many cases, the photos I’ve taken are the last record of someone’s presence. That weight is not lost on me. </p>
<p> In a time when we are inundated with images—scrolling endlessly through curated feeds and polished filters—I’ve learned to resist the urge to stage or perfect. Life isn’t perfect, and that’s precisely what makes it beautiful. I’m not chasing the ideal; I’m chasing the real. I want to remember how things felt, not just how they looked. That’s why I’ll always choose grain over gloss, movement over stillness, truth over trend. </p>
<p> I often return to old photos—ones I took years ago, sometimes decades. What strikes me isn’t necessarily the composition or technique, but the context. The story behind the frame. Who we were then, what we didn’t know yet, how much has changed. A photograph is a time capsule, yes, but it’s also a mirror. It shows us not only what was, but what mattered. </p>
<p> Some of my most cherished images are not of celebrations or posed portraits, but of ordinary life. A quiet breakfast with my father. My niece coloring on the floor, unaware of the world. A friend smoking a cigarette on the fire escape at dusk. These are the photos I return to when I want to remember who we really were—unguarded, unfiltered, human. </p>
<p> I’ve photographed weddings, protests, funerals, births. I’ve documented moments of elation and devastation. And through it all, I’ve come to understand that photography is not just about seeing—it’s about honoring. Honoring what it means to be alive in this particular moment, with these particular people, in this particular light. </p>
<p> Sometimes I wonder what will happen to my work after I’m gone. I hope someone finds the boxes or drives or prints and takes the time to look. Really look. Because within those images are not just faces and places, but entire lives. Entire histories. The story of a generation, perhaps. Or simply the story of one person who cared enough to keep clicking. </p>
<p> To photograph is to believe that something matters—that it’s worth preserving, worth holding on to. And in that sense, every photo I take is an act of hope. Hope that someone, someday, will want to remember. Will need to remember. </p>
<p> So no, I don’t often appear in the frame. But I’m there—in the choice of subject, in the angle, in the light, in the love. My camera may be the tool, but my presence is etched into every image. The same way a writer leaves themselves in every line, I leave myself in every frame. </p>
<p> Our photos are our legacy. Not because they last forever—but because they remind us, even briefly, that we did. </p>
<p> We were here.`, 'float-right')">Read More</div>

        <h3>CAT MANIA</h3>
        <div class="article-content">
          <h4>How Cat Photography Defines Generational Humor</h4>
          <div class="article-byline">Article by: Tyler Murdoch</div>
          <img src="catmeme 2.png" alt="Cat meme" class="center-img">
          <p>LOLcats taught a generation how to meme...</p>
          <div class="read-more" onclick="openModal(`CAT MANIA`, `How Cat Photography Defines Generational Humor`, `Tyler Murdoch`, 'catmeme.png', `LOLcats taught a generation how to meme. But beneath the humor lies a reflection of our relationship to animals, technology, and ourselves. Cat photos have transcended simple amusement—they’ve become cultural timestamps, documenting humor and history alike. Long before algorithms dictated our attention spans, a fuzzy feline with misspelled captions managed to unite the internet in laughter. “I Can Has Cheezburger?” wasn’t just a funny phrase—it was a revolution. A clumsily captioned image of a wide-eyed British Shorthair launched a thousand imitators, spinning off a whole genre of absurdist cat content that would ultimately help define the early meme era. But why cats? Why not dogs or hamsters or parrots?
<p> have long held a strange power over the human imagination. In ancient Egypt, they were revered as gods. In medieval Europe, they were feared as witches’ familiars. And in 21st-century cyberspace, they became avatars for our shared absurdity. With their expressive faces, unpredictable behavior, and mysterious self-possession, cats made the perfect canvas for a new kind of storytelling—one that thrived on relatability, nonsense, and a pinch of existential angst. </p>
<p>What LOLcats offered was more than escapism. They gave us a language. “Ceiling Cat is watching you.” “Invisible Bike.” “No can haz.” These fractured, childlike phrasings weren’t just jokes; they were the foundation of an internet dialect—a way of communicating that rejected grammar and seriousness in favor of collective joy. And that, in turn, opened up a new kind of digital intimacy. You didn’t have to be cool or witty or fluent in coding to participate in the meme economy—you just needed a cat and a bad pun. </p>
<p>In retrospect, the rise of LOLcats coincided with a deeper shift. The mid-2000s were a period of rapid digital transformation. Social media was taking off. Forums were becoming communities. And for the first time, regular people could broadcast their creativity to a global audience. The LOLcat was a gateway drug to participatory culture. It told us: “You don’t need to be an artist or a comedian. Just join in.” </p>
<p>And we did. Millions of us. From suburban teenagers to office workers hiding browser tabs during lunch breaks. Posting a cat meme became a low-stakes, high-reward form of engagement. You weren’t just consuming the internet—you were helping shape it. In a way, LOLcats democratized humor. </p>
<p>But there’s something deeper, too. In our affection for internet cats lies an expression of how we’ve anthropomorphized not only our pets but ourselves. We saw our moods in Grumpy Cat’s frown. We saw our anxiety in Keyboard Cat’s frantic jamming. We projected personalities, backstories, and entire inner lives onto these animals—sometimes more elaborate than the ones we’d assign real people. Why? Because in a world that was becoming increasingly fragmented and fast-paced, these characters gave us something stable, something familiar. A cat, after all, is a creature of ritual. They nap, they groom, they observe. They’re both solitary and present. In many ways, they became our mirror. </p>
<p>Internet cats are also a study in nostalgia. Look back at the image quality of those early memes—pixelated, poorly lit, hastily cropped. Yet they persist in our memory with remarkable clarity. That low-res aesthetic is now almost comforting. It reminds us of a more innocent internet—before influencer culture, before targeted ads, before the algorithm decided what kind of person you are. The LOLcat era feels quaint now, but that’s what makes it precious. </p>
<p>And let’s not forget the communal joy. At its peak, “I Can Has Cheezburger?” wasn’t just a site—it was a hub of user-submitted content, moderated by a community that collectively shaped its voice and norms. People bonded over their love of these ridiculous cats. They voted, commented, and even created entire mythologies: Ceiling Cat vs. Basement Cat, Monorail Cat, Longcat, and his nemesis Tacgnol (Longcat spelled backwards). These weren’t just jokes—they were world-building. </p>
<p>As memes evolved, so did our cats. They went from LOLcats to reaction gifs to TikToks of cats doing parkour off kitchen cabinets. They adapted. They stayed relevant. Unlike most viral trends, cats never disappeared—they just changed formats. Even now, amid the rise of AI-generated content and hyper-curated influencer pets, there’s still something uniquely powerful about an awkward cat video. It cuts through the noise. </p>
<p>And in the backdrop of all this is our shifting relationship with animals. The internet didn’t invent our love for pets, but it magnified it. It blurred the line between companion and content. It turned domestic cats into minor celebrities, complete with merch lines and fanbases. It raised real questions about consent and exploitation—can a cat be commodified? Should a pet have a social media account? What are we really doing when we record an animal doing something “funny”? Are we documenting life—or scripting it? </p>
<p>The ethical landscape here is murky. For every wholesome cat video, there are others that feel exploitative or staged. And as viewers, we’ve had to become more discerning. But even amid that tension, one truth remains: our love for cats, digital or otherwise, is enduring. They ground us. They amuse us. They remind us to pause, stretch, and occasionally knock things off shelves just because we can. </p>
<p>More than a decade after LOLcats stormed the web, their legacy lives on—not just in memes, but in how we relate to media, humor, and each other. Every time you caption a photo, tag a friend in a silly video, or react with a crying-laugh emoji, you're engaging in a tradition that LOLcats helped normalize. A tradition of playful irreverence. Of shared absurdity. Of finding meaning in the meaningless. </p>
<p>So yes, it’s easy to laugh at a cat with toast on its face. But beneath that laughter is something tender. Something human. Our urge to capture, caption, and share reveals our deep need to connect—to say, “Look at this. Isn’t it ridiculous? Isn’t it great? Aren’t we all in this together?” </p>
<p>And maybe that’s what makes LOLcats so iconic. They weren’t just images. They were invitations. To play, to laugh, to see the world through the curious eyes of a creature that doesn’t care what day it is or how many followers it has. A creature that lives fully in each moment—whether it’s chasing a laser dot or sleeping in a box two sizes too small. </p>
<p>In the end, cat photos taught us more than how to meme. They taught us how to participate. How to care. How to find lightness even when things feel heavy. They gave us a shared language before we even realized we needed one. </p>
<p>And in a world still trying to figure out what it means to be online, that’s no small thing.`, 'center-img')">Read More</div>

Long before Hollywood conjured Dracula or the Creature from the Black Lagoon, before latex masks and prosthetic gore, there existed an older, quieter form of horror—one born from glass plates, silver nitrate, and long exposure times. The origins of visual terror are not in the cinema, but in the camera.
<p> In the Victorian era, photography was both a technological marvel and a tool for the uncanny. It was, after all, a medium obsessed with capturing time—pausing the fleeting, freezing the ephemeral. But within this attempt to immortalize came something eerie. The early photographic process was slow, requiring subjects to sit motionless for long stretches. This resulted in ghostly blurs, unintended double exposures, and the unsettling stillness of posed figures who look as though they’re watching from beyond. </p>
<p>Perhaps the most chilling expression of this stillness was found in post-mortem photography. In the 19th century, when mortality rates were high and photography was still prohibitively expensive, families often commissioned portraits of the dead as their only visual remembrance. Infants and children were common subjects. The deceased would be carefully dressed and positioned in lifelike poses—sometimes seated in chairs, sometimes propped up with open eyes painted onto closed lids. In some images, they’re cradled by grieving parents or surrounded by living siblings, making it nearly impossible at first glance to discern who among them is no longer breathing. It is in this uneasy tension—between life and death, between memory and memento mori—that photographic horror quietly took root. </p>
<p>While post-mortem portraits were acts of mourning and reverence, spirit photography delved deeper into the supernatural. Pioneered by frauds like William H. Mumler in the 1860s, spirit photographs purported to show the ghosts of departed loved ones hovering near the living. These spectral figures were typically achieved through double exposures or manipulation during development, but their effect was profound. In a time of rampant disease, war, and spiritual curiosity, these ghostly apparitions offered comfort to the bereaved—and fueled the era’s growing fascination with the afterlife. </p>
<p>But spirit photography was more than sentimental deception. It tapped into collective fears and longings, blurring the boundary between science and séance. Even as photography was seen as a truthful medium—objective, mechanical, incapable of lying—it was also used to conjure illusions. The paradox of using a supposedly honest technology to fabricate the supernatural laid the groundwork for the genre of horror itself: what frightens us most is not the clearly false, but the almost believable. </p>
<p>In the dim lighting and heavy shadows of early photography, we also find the roots of gothic aesthetics that would later dominate horror cinema. Daguerreotypes and tintypes, with their rich contrasts and tendency to emphasize bone structure, rendered even the living as slightly spectral. Studio lighting—then rudimentary—cast deep, dramatic shadows. Unintentional effects, like lens flares and light leaks, added a surreal, otherworldly quality. In many cases, these images feel more like paintings from a fever dream than scientific documents. </p>
<p>And then there are the photographs that horrify not through intention or trickery, but through reality. Crime scene photos, battlefield documentation, medical anomalies—the camera did not shy away from the grotesque. Mathew Brady’s photographs of Civil War dead brought the cost of conflict into stark relief, showing bloated bodies and torn uniforms to a shocked public. In Europe, clinical photographs of the ill, the deformed, and the institutionalized fed both scientific curiosity and voyeuristic horror. These images were not staged. Their terror lay in their truth. </p>
<p>It’s no surprise, then, that the language of horror film borrows heavily from these photographic precedents. The tilted head of the corpse. The blank stare. The veiled woman in black. The child with impossibly still eyes. Even the idea of the photograph as a cursed object—a theme seen in films like The Ring or Sinister—can trace its roots to this era, when photographs were seen not just as images, but as vessels. To look at a picture was to conjure a presence. To be photographed was, in some way, to be possessed by the lens. </p>
<p>As cinema emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it adopted these visual tropes wholesale. Georges Méliès, an early magician of film, used photographic techniques like double exposure and time-lapse to create ghosts and transformations. German Expressionist films such as Nosferatu (1922) relied on dramatic lighting, stark contrasts, and angular compositions—techniques that mirrored the chiaroscuro of daguerreotypes. Even today’s horror films, with their love of grain, blur, and vintage filters, evoke the aesthetic of antique photographs, as if to suggest that the past is always watching, always waiting. </p>
<p>Photography also gave us one of horror’s most persistent themes: the terror of being seen. To be photographed is to be fixed, observed, scrutinized. In countless horror stories, the act of taking a photo is what invites the malevolent force. The camera doesn’t just record—it reveals. It sees what the human eye cannot. And in that revelation lies both wonder and fear. </p>
<p>In contemporary horror, we see this legacy play out in countless ways. Found footage films like Paranormal Activity and The Blair Witch Project inherit their unease from grainy stills and lo-fi images. The distorted faces and spectral figures of The Ring echo the falsified ghosts of spirit photography. Even high-concept art horror, such as Hereditary or Midsommar, uses the aesthetics of still photography—symmetry, contrast, frozen time—to create unease. </p>
<p>And yet, for all its influence, photographic horror retains a singular power. There is something uniquely disturbing about stillness. A photograph asks us to linger. To stare. Unlike film, it doesn’t move, doesn’t cut away. It traps its subject—and us—in a single moment forever. And that, perhaps, is the most terrifying thing of all. </p>
<p>In the end, the roots of horror are not in the screams or jump scares, but in the quiet dread of recognition—the feeling that something is not quite right, that the image is watching back. Before the ghosts walked, before the dead rose, and before the monsters crawled from the shadows, there was a photograph. A still frame. A mirror of mortality. </p>
<p>And we have not stopped looking since. </p>
